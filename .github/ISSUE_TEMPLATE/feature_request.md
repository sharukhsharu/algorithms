I welcome your suggestions for future revisions of the textbook.  These could include suggestions for additional material (some of which may already be covered in my related lecture notes) or new examples or intuition or exercises that you find helpful.  Alternatively, these could include requests for additional detail in material that you find tricky, or _reduced_ detail in material you find excessive.  

Please be as specific in your request as possible.
